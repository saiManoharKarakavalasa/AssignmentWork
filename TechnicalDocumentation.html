    <h2>Objects And Classes</h2>
    <p>Objects and classes</p>
    <p>Objects in Java
        Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.
        
        If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.
        
        If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.
        
        Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.
        
        So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.
        
        Classes in Java
        A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

<div class="abstraction col-md-9" id="abstraction">
  
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction</p>
    <p>Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process wherein general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods.

        "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.[1]
        
        Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, selecting only those aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.[1] In a type–token distinction, a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').
        
        Abstraction in its secondary use is a material process,[2] discussed in the themes below.
                    
    </p>
     <p>
        Abstraction involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. 
        It is the opposite of specification, which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts.
         Abstraction can be illustrated by Francis Bacon's Novum Organum (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late Jacobean era[3] of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.

         Bacon used and promoted induction as an abstraction tool; 
         it complemented but was distinct from the ancient deductive-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like Thales,
          Anaximander, and Aristotle.[4] Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea,
           "everything is water," to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.
         Modern scientists used the approach of abstraction (going from particular facts collected into one general idea). 
         Newton (1642–1727) derived the motion of the planets from Copernicus' (1473–1543) simplification, 
         that the sun is the center of our solar system; Kepler (1571–1630) compressed thousands of measurements into one expression to finally
          conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun; Galileo (1564–1642) repeated one hundred specific experiments into the law of falling bodies.

         <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
         <p>Polymorphism</p>
         <p>In programming language theory and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types[1] or the use of a single 
            symbol to represent multiple different types.
            [2] The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages.[3]

         </p>
          <p>
            Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function).
             This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.
             Static polymorphism executes faster, because there is no dynamic dispatch overhead, but requires additional compiler support. Further, static polymorphism allows greater static 
             analysis by compilers (notably for optimization), source code analysis tools, and human readers (programmers). Dynamic polymorphism is more flexible but slower—for example, 
             dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing, and a dynamically linked library may operate on objects without knowing their full type.
            Static polymorphism typically occurs in ad hoc polymorphism and parametric polymorphism, whereas dynamic polymorphism is usual for subtype polymorphism. However, it is possible
            to achieve static polymorphism with subtyping through more sophisticated use of template metaprogramming, namely the curiously recurring template pattern.
             When polymorphism is exposed via a library, static polymorphism becomes impossible for dynamic libraries as there is no way of knowing what types the parameters are when the 
             shared object is built. While languages like C++ and Rust use monomorphized templates, the Swift programming language makes extensive use of dynamic dispatch to build the
              application binary interface for these libraries by default. As a result, more code can be shared for a reduced system size at the cost of runtime overhead.[10].

              <p>In software systems, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data.
                 It may also refer to the limiting of direct access to some of that data, such as an object's components.[1] Encapsulation allows developers to present a 
                 consistent and usable interface which is independent of how a system is implemented internally. As one example, encapsulation can be used to hide the values or 
                 state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate 
                 state invariance maintained by the methods.In software systems, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data.

                Under the definition that encapsulation "can be used to hide data members and member functions", the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from 
                view outside of the object's definition. Typically, only the object's own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields. Hiding the internals of the object
                 protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state. A supposed benefit of encapsulation 
                 is that it can reduce system complexity, and thus increase robustness, by allowing the developer to limit the interdependencies between software components.[citation needed]
                Some languages like Smalltalk and Ruby only allow access via object methods, but most others (e.g., C++, C#, Delphi or Java) offer the programmer a degree of control over what
                 is hidden, typically via keywords like public and private.[6] ISO C++ standard refers to protected, private and public as "access specifiers" and that they do not "hide
                  any information". Information hiding is accomplished by furnishing a compiled version of the source code that is interfaced via a header file.
                Almost always, there is a way to override such protection – usually via reflection API (Ruby, Java, C#, etc.), sometimes by mechanism like name mangling (Python),
                 or special keyword usage like friend in C++. Systems that provide object-level capability-based security (adhering to the object-capability model) are an exception, 
                 and guarantee strong encapsulation.
